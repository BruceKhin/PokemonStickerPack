To play around the sticker app extensions with the Messages app, we made this sticker pack. Technically, it is super easy to make a sticker pack for iOS 10 Messages app. I spent most of the time on finding the fair use for educational purpose images (if Google Images results are correct), using Sketch to crop and resize the images and waiting for Xcode 8 beta crashes 😵
